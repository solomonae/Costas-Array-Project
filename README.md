# Costas-Array-Project


## Fall 2024/Spring 2025 Costas Array Project
This is a senior project. 

## Summary
Costas Arrays are mathematical significant arrays that have an auto-correlation that peaks only when it is alligned with itself on both axis, here the axis are time and frequency, and no significant value anywhere else. The success of this project can allow a new way to research the effects the Ionishpere has on signals, and specifically short wave signals in this project.
